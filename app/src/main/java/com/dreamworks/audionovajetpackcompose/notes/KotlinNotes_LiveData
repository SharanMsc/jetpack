LiveData
---------
Its an observable data holder class
Observable means livedata can be observed by other
components like activity or fragment
Live data has the knowledge about the lifecycle of
its observers like activity or fragment
live data only update the observers which are in its
active lifecycle

Eg:
private val data = MutableLiveData<Int>()

 viewModel.finished().observe(this, Observer {
            if(it){
                // if count time finished it set the value
                textView.text = "Finished"
            }
        })

Advantage
No need to update the ui everytime
Live data notify observer if any change occurs

No memory leaks
Observers are bound to lifecycle objects
and clean up after themselves
when their associate lifecycle destroyed
