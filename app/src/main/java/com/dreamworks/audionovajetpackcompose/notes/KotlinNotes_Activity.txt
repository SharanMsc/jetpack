Activity lifecycle

onCreate
Calls when the activity first created.
Here all the static work like creating views, binding data to list ets
it provide bundle that contain the previous frozen state
onStart
Invoked when activity visible to user
It is followed by the onResume if the activity invoked from the background
It invoked after onCreate
onRestart
It invoked after the activity has been stopped and prior to its starting stage,
thus always followed by the onStart when activity revived from background
onResume
It invoked when the activity start interact with the user
onPause
It invoked when activity is going to background and has not yet been killed
onStop
It invoke activity is not visible to user
onDestroy
it is the final call receive before the activity destroyed

To handle configuration change to use technique such as
retaining fragment with setRetainInstance(true) to preserve the critical data
during configuration changes
And also use ViewModel to store Ui related data
