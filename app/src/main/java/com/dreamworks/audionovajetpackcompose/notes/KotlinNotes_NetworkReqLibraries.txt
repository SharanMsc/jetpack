Network Request Libraries
-------------------------
To make network request  using two libraries
in android are retrofit and okhttp

Retrofit
its a popular choice for building typ-safe restful apis.
It simplify the process of making network calls by converting
json response into java/kotlin objects

Okhttp
it is a low level http client for making network requests.
Its used in conjunction with retrofit

Additionally android provide classes like AsyncTask,
HttpRlConnection, and volley for making network requests.
But these are less recommended due to their limitations and
complexities
